# FaceOff

## Getting started

Hi Team! I'm glad you joined our machine learning project. This project is a Blazor Server application that leverages Machine Learning to detect and classify the emotional state of a person based on their facial expressions in an image. The system captures the user's face and processes the image through a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the emotion displayed. Supported emotions include happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and others.

The application aims to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience where users can upload images of their faces, and the system will instantly analyze the emotions and return the predicted result. This can be used in various applications, such as improving user interaction, sentiment analysis, or emotion-driven AI systems.

Prerequisites:

- Visual Studio 2022
  - Workloads
    - ASP.NET and web development
  - Individual components
    - ML.NET Model Builder
